# This is a simple student database management system. implmented with txt file

*using c and c++ concepts mixed together....
* It utilizes file handling and shows effective implementation of class and objects. 
** or at least it trys to this is a mix of c and c++ concepts and they don't mix well(or rather i havent been able to get it working) 

* again this does not work properly so if you are gonna look at the code just be aware
