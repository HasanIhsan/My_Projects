## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

> Or any other IDE's that you might think would work, I personally work in VS and VSC

### Installing

Simple open the projects in any IDE and hit run.

For C#/C/C++ opening them in VS and hitting run will work.
For Java you could use VSC or Esclipse (or any other IDE that works with Java).
For the others just use VSC.
