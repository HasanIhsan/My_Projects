This Repo Contains all my current worked on projects and samples that I didn't believe needed there own repo. If you like what you see Contact me!
> NOTE: one important thing to note, the reason these project don't have there own repo, is becuase there either examples or projects I didn't think needed there own repo (I will go back and sort out the once I need to create a repo for)

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

> Or any other IDE's that you might think would work, I personally work in VS and VSC

### Installing

Simply open the projects in any IDE and hit run.

For C#/C/C++ opening them in VS and hitting run will work.
For Java you could use VSC or Esclipse (or any other IDE that works with Java).
For the others just use VSC.

> I use VC for C#/C/C++ development and for anything else I use VC
