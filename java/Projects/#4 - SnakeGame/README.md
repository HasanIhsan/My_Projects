# Java_snakeGame
This is my first actual simple game created using java.

to run the program you probably need a java compiler ( i use VSC so it does everything for me) 
also the main is located in the snakegame.java (run the main method)

or run the exe file (if you don't trust the exe then please compile the code using a compiler)

Controls:
to control the snake just use the arrow keys
